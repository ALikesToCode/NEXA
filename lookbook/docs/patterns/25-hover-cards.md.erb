The HoverCard is a pattern related to the `Primer::Beta::Popover` and is used to show additional information on any kind of resource. The hover card is opened by hovering a certain trigger. When hovering outside of the card or its trigger, the popover is closed again.

## Overview

![Exemplary hover card](<%= image_path('lookbook/hover_card.png') %>)

## Anatomy

The HoverCard always consists of two basic parts:

1. A trigger: That can be anything that is hoverable
2. The actual card: A small popover is opened directly next to the trigger. The actual content of the card depends on the resource that is hovered.


## Best practices

**Do**

- Have a slight delay between hovering and opening the card
- Keep the content of the card simple


**Don't**

- Put interactive elements inside of the card. As the popover closes as soon as you move the mouse out, it will trigger users confusion.
- Put too many triggers on one page, as it can otherwise become annoying.

## Used in

- WorkPackage preview when linking via `#ID`
- Soon: User preview when hovering the avatar

## Technical notes

Unfortunately, we could not easily use the `Primer::Beta::Popover` component.
That is why, the `HoverCard` is technically an Angular modal which renders inside a `turboFrame`.
This modal is triggered by a class called `op-hover-card--preview-trigger` which can be set in any element.
A global event listener is registered on all elements with this class and triggers the modal when being hovered.
Additionally, the trigger element needs to pass the URL for the `turboFrame` as a data attribute called `data-hover-card-url`.

### Code structure

**Angular modal**:
```html
 <!-- frontend/src/app/shared/components/modals/preview-modal/hover-card-modal/hover-card.modal.html -->
<div
  class="op-hover-card"
>
  <turbo-frame
    loading="lazy"
    id="op-hover-card-body"
    [src]="turboFrameSrc">
  </turbo-frame>
</div>
```

**Trigger**:
```html
  <!-- app/views/module_a/index.html.erb -->
  <a href="work_packages/14/activity"
     data-hover-card-url="work_packages/14/hover_card"
     class="op-hover-card--preview-trigger">
    #14
  </a>
```

**Actually rendered card content**:
```html
  <!-- app/components/work_packages/hover_card/show.html.erb -->
  <turbo-frame id="op-hover-card-body">
    &lt;%= render WorkPackages::HoverCardComponent.new(id: 14) %&gt;
  </turbo-frame>
  %&gt;
```

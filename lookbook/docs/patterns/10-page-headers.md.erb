# Page Headers

This component, Page Header, is an adaptation to fir OpenProject requirements of the React component Page Header of primer. This document will only state the points that differ from what **[Primer specifies](https://primer.style/components/page-header)** about this component in their documentation.

## Anatomy

There are minor adjustments on how the composition of this component is defined in Primer for OpenProject:

**[Context bar](https://primer.style/components/page-header#context-bar):** Will be always present in all pages and will change depending on the viewport:

- **Desktop:** the content of the context bar will be a [breadcrumb](https://primer.style/components/breadcrumbs).
- **Tablet:** the content of the context bar will be a [breadcrumb](https://primer.style/components/breadcrumbs).
- **Mobile:** the content will use the parent link style with context bar actions, moving all the page header actions to it in a single [Icon button](https://primer.style/components/icon-button).

**[Title bar](https://primer.style/components/page-header#title-bar):** The default (medium) size will be always used keeping the capability as optionals of adding leading and trailing visuals and actions.

**Actions:** A maximum amount of 5 actions can be displayed independently in the Page Header actions. If there are more than 5 actions the last one will be an [Icon button](https://primer.style/components/icon-button) with a more action, this one will trigger all the extra actions in a dropdown. All actions require their own icon.

**Divider**: The divider bellow the Page Header will be always present with the exception of displaying a [Tav nav](https://primer.style/components/tab-nav) as navigation element bellow.

## **Exceptional behaviours**

- A special behaviour occurs when the page can be saved (or saved as) as one of the Page Header actions will be used to display an informational text and a link to perform the action.
- Work packages details would be the only exceptional case where the breadcrumb will be used to display the parent work package instead of the navigational hierarchy.

## Best practices

**Do**

- Limit the actions of the Page Header to the global actions of the page (e. for a work package list: favourite, share, full-screen, …). *Note: this can not be 100% fulfilled until the Primer page sub-headers are implemented.*
- Use the H1 tag always for the Page Header even if the default Page Header doesn’t contain this tag in the code.
- All actions require their own icon.
- Use Icon buttons instead of buttons for actions only when the icon is clear enough to describe the action.

**Don't**

- Don’t use the trailing action in the page header as navigation element “back”, the breadcrumb and the browser back are covering this case.
- Use Page Headers as section sub-header inside of the content of the page.

## Used in

The Page Header is a navigational mandatory component in all pages that will always use as title the name of the page where is contained.

This file keeps track of some shortcuts taken while developing % Complete new calculation.

They should eventually be addressed.

* Add feature test to ensure that in Gantt charts, when customizing the display to have % Complete in the chart, the value being displayed does not have the total " . âˆ‘ xx%" in it. It should only display the percentage value.

* Remove the leading attribute name in validation messages in popover for work and remaining work

        You can remove this user as a direct project member but a group they are in is also a member of this project, so they will continue being a member via the group.
        Also, [shared work packages link] have been shared with this user.

        You cannot delete this member because they belong to a group that is itself a member of this project.
        You can either remove the group as a member of the project or this specific member from the group in the [administration settings link].

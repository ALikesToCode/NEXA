    When calling this endpoint, the client provides a single object containing the properties and links to be
    created, in the body. The input is validated and a schema response is returned. If the validation errors of the
    response is empty, the same payload can be used to create a work package.

    Only the properties of the work package write model are allowed to set on a work package on creation.

    When setting start date, finish date, and duration together, their correctness will be checked and a validation
    error will be returned if one value does not match with the two others. You can make the server compute a value:
    set only two values in the request and the third one will be computed and returned in the response. For instance,
    when sending `{ "startDate": "2022-08-23", duration: "P2D" }`, the response will
    include `{ "dueDate": "2022-08-24" }`.

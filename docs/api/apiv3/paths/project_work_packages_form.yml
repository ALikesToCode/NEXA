  summary: Work Package Create Form For Project
  operationId: Work_Package_Create_Form_For_Project
  tags:
    - Work Packages
  description: |-
    This endpoint allows you to validation a new work package creation body in a specific project. It works similarly
    to the `/api/v3/work_packages/form` endpoint, but already specifies the work package's project in the path, so that
    it does not have to be defined in the request body.
  parameters:
    - name: id
      description: ID of the project in which the work package will be created
      in: path
      required: true
      schema:
        type: integer
      example: '1'
  requestBody:
    content:
      application/json:
        schema:
          $ref: '../components/schemas/work_package_write_model.yml'
  responses:
    '200':
      description: OK
      content:
